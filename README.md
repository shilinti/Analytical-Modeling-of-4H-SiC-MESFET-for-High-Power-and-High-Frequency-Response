# Analytical-Modeling-of-4H-SiC-MESFET-for-High-Power-and-High-Frequency-Response
This is the simulation for a analytical model of 4H-SIC (silicon carbide) MESFETS. The model has been developed to obtain the threshold voltage, drain-source current, intrinsic parameters such as, gate capacitance, drain-source resistance and transconductance considering different fabrication parameters such as ion dose, ion energy, ion range and annealing effect parameters
